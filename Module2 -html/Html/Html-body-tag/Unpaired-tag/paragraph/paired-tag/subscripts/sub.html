    <p>A subscripts is a charecter, usually a letter or number, that's printed slightly below and to the<br> 
        side of the another charecter. subscripts are commonly used in chemical formulas. A scientist would<br>
        write the formula for water, <b>H<sub>2</sub>O</b> so that 2 appears lowers and smaller than the latters<br>
    on either side of it.   </p>
