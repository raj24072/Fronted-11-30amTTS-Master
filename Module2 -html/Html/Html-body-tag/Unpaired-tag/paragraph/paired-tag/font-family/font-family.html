        <h1>Quotes by Famous People</h1>
        
        <p><b>1.</b>The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. <br><b>-Nelson Mandela</b></p>
        <p><b>2.</b>Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma-which is living with the results of other people's thinking. <b>-Steve Jobs</b></p>
        <p><b>3.</b>If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor. <b>-Eleanor Roosevelt</b></p>
        <p><b>4.</b>If you look at what you have in life, you'll always have more. If you look at what you don't have in life, you'll never have enough. <b>-Oprah Winfrey</b></p>
